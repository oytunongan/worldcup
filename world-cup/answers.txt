Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Top predictions differ as decreasing when increasing simulations. TODO

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 1000 simulations winner chance does not differ significantly, so no need to proceed further. TODO
